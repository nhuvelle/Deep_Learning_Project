    "For my project I will be doing addressing a classification problem of categorizing images of ships as military, carrier, cruise, cargo, yacht, or other. Building a useful model for this problem could potentially help with supply chain issues in the Sea or identifying enemy military ships from a distance. The dataset is from Kaggle.com. A CNN model seems appropriate, and a MVP would be a model that works reasonably well. "
